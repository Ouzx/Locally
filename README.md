This project with React-Native is for small and medium-sized businesses, offices, teams, groups and communities. The project basically aims for a group to have a common contact. For example, when a your customer calls your business, the customer should be automatically registered in the system and grouped. For this, I wanted to create a cloud-based React-Native project. This project, which I will write the back end part of with Node.js Express, is actually an effort I designed to improve myself. This is LOCALLY.
